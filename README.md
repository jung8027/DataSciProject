Our goal is to explore the relationship between asthma prevalence and mold complaint rates across New York City’s UHF neighborhoods. Specifically, we aim to determine whether areas with higher mold rates also report higher asthma cases and identify common environmental or demographic factors that may influence these trends.
Research Questions

What is the relationship between mold complaint rates and asthma rates across NYC districts?

Do coastal areas (e.g., Rockaway, Riverside, Long Island City) have higher mold or asthma rates compared to inland districts?

What environmental or demographic factors (air quality, humidity, pollen, income, race, housing conditions) correlate with higher asthma or mold prevalence?

Can we predict asthma rates from mold rates and other features using regression or classification models?

Data Sources


We plan to collect data from:

NYC Open Data (311 Service Requests for mold complaints)

NYC Department of Health (Asthma rates by UHF neighborhood)

EPA and NOAA (air quality, humidity, precipitation)

U.S. Census/ACS (demographic data)

Methodology

Data Collection: Scrape or download public datasets and join by UHF district or ZIP code.

Data Cleaning: Standardize location names, handle missing data, and normalize rates per 10,000 residents.

Analysis:

Compute correlations between mold and asthma rates.

Compare results across boroughs and coastal vs. inland areas.

Visualize trends using scatterplots, bar charts, and NYC choropleth maps.

Modeling (Optional): Use regression models to identify key factors influencing asthma rates.

Interpretation & Presentation: Highlight key findings, patterns, and recommendations in our final report and slides.
